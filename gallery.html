						<a href="media/2015/andywarhol.jpg" data-lightbox="andy-warhol" data-title="<h3>Andy Warhol Teacher Project (Feb. 2015)</h3><p>Project: Take pictures of teachers and 'color' them using Andy Warhol's style.</p><p>Reflection: This project was the most entertaining thing I did in Photoshop. Andy Warhol's style is to use bright colors to color people's faces. It's more outstanding, unique, and funny. I got into groups of four and we did a total of six teachers and each one of us went off with a different color scheme. Unfortunately, at the end when we compose them together, similar colors were next to each other and it looked ugly. So we spent more time fixing these issues and changing up the colors. This is our final collage! I believe all of us enjoyed this fun project in Photoshop.</p>"><img src ="media/2015/andywarholTbn.jpg" alt="Andy Warhol Teacher Project"></a>

						<a href="media/2015/ad.jpg" data-lightbox="advertisement1" data-title="<h3>Anti-Bullying Advertisement (Mar. 2015)</h3><p>Project: Incorporate an anti-bullying advertisement in the satirical newpaper for English class.</p><p>Reflection: I am not a good writer but rather a good artist. So for the English satirical newspaper PBL, I decided to help out and make the advertisements. I actually put a lot of effort into this little advertisement because I wanted to make it custom so I drew it in Photoshop. The advertisement showcases two situations. The top row was grayscaled because I wanted to show a sense of depression caused by bullying. On the bottom, it is what happens when people help other. It can 'brighten up a world'. I really enjoy making this ad and I think it is unique.</p>"><img src ="media/2015/adTbn.jpg" alt="Advertisement for Anti-Bullying"></a>
						
						<a href="media/2015/fable.jpg" data-lightbox="fable" data-title="<h3>Animated Fable (Apr. 2015)</h3><p>Project: Turn an Aesop's fable into an animation.</p><p>Reflection: The first major project Web kids did in Flash. It was difficult for me to finish or even start animating. There were two different drawing modes and without paying attention, it can ruin the project. In addition, I know drawing in Illustrator better than drawing directly in Flash. So importing files from illustrator and animating them cause many troubles since the files cannot be edited in Flash. I spent a long time switching between Illustrator and Flash. Symbol was another troubling part for me. Some symbols can work inside a symbol and it just got very complicated. After about 2 months, I finally finished my animation. I think it is a great software but it's extremely difficult for me to use since I am not use to drawing in Flash and breaking the body parts out that will need movements.

						<a href="media/2015/dante.jpg" data-lightbox="danteHomePage" data-title="<h3>Dante Inferno's Website Home Graphic (May 2015)</h3><p>Project: Our English teacher wanted the Web Design students to create an informational website for the upcoming sophomore English students about Dante Alighieri. Students must do research and planning to create the final product because every step of the process is important.</p><p>Reflection: It was the first website we sophomores ever created for a real client, which is our English teacher. We've learned the process of building a website from scratch. There's research, wireframe, mock-up, coding(HTML and CSS), and finally presenting. It's a very great experience for us because we need to figure out a solution for a client. There are specific needs that need to be accomplished and it's important to work with people. We divided the tasks within our group so the process can be faster and more efficient. However, throughout the process, there were arguing. But it's a great opportunity for us students to work with people that you might not like (just like in the real world) in order to complete an assignment that can not be delayed.</p>"><img src ="media/2015/danteTbn.jpg" alt="Graphic for HellCTA"></a>

						<a href="media/2015/brianhead.jpg" data-lightbox="brianHeadPoster" data-title="<h3>Brian Head Art Festival Poster (May 2015)</h3><p>Project: To create a poster for an art festival at Brian Head, Utah</p><p>Reflection: Brian Head is in a valley just like Las Vegas. However, it's much smaller and surrounded by national parks such as Cedar Breaks. It's also very close to other national parks like Zion and Bryce. So I decided to draw a deer that's a common animal of that area. Instead of just add the plain antlers, I replaced them with a pretty brush effect and rainbow colors. In my mind, those flowing antlers gives me a sense of freedom and creativity which I think suits the theme of an art festival. I also enjoyed this project because painting is a very relaxing thing to do.</p>"><img src ="media/2015/brianheadTbn.jpg" alt="Brian Head Art Festival poster"></a>
							
						<a href="media/2015/emma.jpg" data-lightbox="emmaWatson" data-title="<h3>Polygon Effect: Emma Watson (Jun. 2015)</h3><p>Reflection: This is an assignment I did over the summer of 2015. I wanted to improve my skills in Photoshop so I looked online to see if there were any tutorials for me to follow. I found photo manipulation tutorials boring and decided to do this cool polygon effect. This effect became really popular and I really wanted to try it out. The process of making this picture is very long because I need to hand select areas on the artwork and fill the colors. But I the final artwork is very beautiful and I think all the time and efforts are worth it. It is definitely something to try again.</p>"><img src ="media/2015/emmaTbn.jpg" alt="Polygon effect Emma Watson Portrait"></a>

						<a href="media/2015/USHistory-infographic.png" data-lightbox="History" data-title="<h3>U.S. History Infographic on Federalists and Anti-Federalists(Oct. 2015)</h3><p>Project: Use infographic to explain an important event or group in Period 3 (1754-1800)</p><p>Reflection: My friend, Solange, and I decided to do the topic of Federalists and Anti-Federalists. The Federalists were people that wanted to have a strong national government while the Anti-Federalists wanted a weak national government and a strong state government. This infographic was a great way for us to review the key political party during Period 3 of U.S History. I enjoyed making my own infographic instead of using a template online. This helps me review my skills and I have the freedom of creating whatever I want. I spent a long time making the map in the middle and my partner helped me with the content. It was a fun project for the both of us and at the same time we learned the history.</p>"><img src ="media/2015/USHistory-infographic-Tbn.jpg" alt="U.S. History Infographic on Federalists and Anti-Federalists"></a>

						<a href="media/2015/javascript-quiz.jpg" data-lightbox="JSquiz" data-title="<h3>Javascript-based Quiz(Oct. 2015)</h3><p>Project: After learning about Javascript. Create a quiz website that uses javascript to collect data and generate questions.</p><p>Reflection: This project was the most difficult project I've ever done. The reason was none of the students really understand javascript. We followed along the video and took notes, but when it comes down to the actual coding, we don't even know where to start. My partner and I first put all the questions in HTML but then we realize we were suppose to put them in the javascript file as an array. This way the questions can be randomly generated. There were hardly any progress while coding, and at the end I asked my Dad to show me javascript and completed the assignment. It was a very difficult project like I said before. I would definitely go back and learn javascrip again since it is very important to make a website look nice and be interactive.

Designing a logo for the Hour of Code or this community service event was a lot of fun. I came up with the idea of robots because it represented the 'code' aspect of the event. I also incorporated the ideas of holding hands because it shows kindness and care towards the kids. My friend executed the idea using Illustrator and we got many feedback from our classmates. At the end, everyone liked the logo and it was a little testing for us to see if we can create a logo that our 'client' will like. </p>"><img src ="media/2015/HOC-logo-Tbn.png" alt="Hour of Code Community Event Logo"></a>

						<a href="media/2015/k-puzzle.png" data-lightbox="HourofCode-art" data-title="<h3>Hour of Code Art Assets: Kindergarten Puzzle (Dec. 2015)</h3><p>Reflection: As a member of the marketing team for this Hour of Code event, I decided to help the Kindergarten to create a puzzle that will be used as one of the activities for the kids. I enjoy making cute designs and this was one of them. I made this puzzle very vibrant and colorful because it will get the kid's attention. It is a very interesting project and I can create something unique and memorable to the kids.</p>"><img src ="media/2015/HOC-puzzleTbn.jpg" alt="Hour of Code Puzzles"></a>

						<a href="media/2015/Code-Says.png" data-lightbox="HourofCode-art" data-title="<h3>Hour of Code Art Assets: Code Says Command Poster</h3><p>This is another art asset for the Hour of Code event. It is for the game Code Says. It is like Simon Says but using the word 'Code'. I wanted to use kids as a main attraction instead of just listing out the commands. This makes the kids pay attention and easy to remember.</p>"></a>

						<a href="media/2015/responsive.jpg" data-lightbox="Responsive" data-title="<h3>Responsive Website of School Website(Dec. 2015)</h3><p>Project: Redesign the <a target='_blank' href='http://www.swcta.net'>school</a> website to make it better and responsive while accessing through a tablet or phone.</p><p>Reflection: This project got everyone excited, including myself, because the school website is really ugly. Our teacher gave us a chance to change the original one and gave us the freedom to make it whatever we want. My group had a lot of fun redesigning it because it is our school website and we wanted to make it more appealing. It also helped us to practice making our website responsive, which is basically styling the HTML a different way so it is legible and efficient on a phone or tablet. I think our website is very beautiful and responsice. I really like the final product.

						<a href ="media/2014/portrait.jpg" data-lightbox="selfPortrait" data-title="<h3>Vector Self-Portrait (Jan. 2014)</h3><p>Project: Using Illustrator to do a self portrait.</p> <p>Reflection: This project was fun because I applied my knowledge of Illustrator in order to do this portrait. Every week there will be a progress check to see how much I did over a week. Students also give each other feedbacks to improve their portrait. As for me, I used gradients and other tools to create a more realistic and smooth feeling. This project took a long time to complete, for example, I completed my background at home, and I spend many more hours editing and fixing it to make it the best.Overall, it was a great project and this artwork got me into the top three candidate for the ACA (Adobe Certified Associate) World Championship of 2015.</p>"><img src ="media/2014/portraitTbn.jpg" alt="Graphic Portrait made in Illustrator"></a>
							
						<a href ="media/2014/ad.jpg" data-lightbox="advertisement2" data-title="<h3>Advertisement Re-design (Feb. 2014)</h3><p>Project: Pick a bad advertisement and redesign it.</p><p>Reflection: I was redesigning an advertisement that was ugly; but the original advertisement was already very good according to the teacher. I wanted to change it so it approaches a different way. The products is obviously Clorox and they're talking about how kids touch lots of objects and germs will eventually stays in the house. If you use Clorox, the germs will be killed immediately. My idea was to filled the house with toys or stuff that kids will probably touch at home. Then the Clorox wipe comes in and wipes the house that will make all the toys clean or 'colorful'. I think the idea is pretty straight forward towards the audience while the original ad uses words to make into a fingerprint. Anyway, I believed that visual images will be more attractive and easy for kids to understand. </p>"><img src ="media/2014/adTbn.jpg" alt="Redesigned Clorox Advertisement"></a>
							
						<a href ="media/2014/titanic.jpg" data-lightbox="titanic" data-title="<h3>Titanic Artwork for Spring Project (Apr. 2014)</h3><p>Project: How 2D graphic and 3D model work together.</p><p>Reflection: This was the Spring PBL for Web Design students. We spent about a month to come up with a theme(famous movies) and a mock up 3D slotted sculpture that we're going to make(empire state building). We also used an application called Aurasma to add some technology into our project. Aurasma is an application when 2D graphic can come into 3D, or an animation. I was the builder and the graphic designer of Titanic. My other teammates did other famous movies such as Indiana Jones, Star Wars, and Jurassic Park. During Wednesday and Thursday or the PBL days, we worked on our slotted sculpture that will be made out of foam boards. We printed out the graphics we made using Illustrator and glued them onto the board. Then we used box cutters to cut out the pieces in order to assemble them. The sculpture was in the form of the Empire State Building and it's divided into 4 sections. The building also had 4 sides, so we demonstrated each movie at a different section at a different side of the building. This way, there was a surprise whenever you look at a different side. A showcare video was also required to go with the project that documented our building process. Anyway, this project was amazing and our sculpture turned out very nicely.</p>"><img src ="media/2014/titanicTbn.jpg" alt="Titanic Graphic"></a>
							
						<a href ="media/2014/mascot.png" data-lightbox="mascot" data-title="<h3>Anti-Drug Use Campaign Mascot (May 2014)</h3><p>Project: Make a campaign for a teen issue your group had chosen. It also needs a take-away or something free to pass to the audience.</p><p>Reflection: My group decided to do the topic on anti-drug use because we believe teens these days are not aware of the harm drugs can bring to them. My group created a website about anti-drug use issue among teens. We thought that website was the best way to get our points across the board because teens surf through the internet almost everyday. We incorporated the logo, mascot, slogan, and additional banner that I created onto the website. This picture above is the mascot. It also contained the damage of drugs, coping strategies, and resources to help addictions. I think this was a very good website my teammate and I created that can stress about the importance of staying away from drugs. <a target='_blank' href='http://17-1011308.wix.com/teen-anti-drug-use'>Website </a>for Anti-Drug Use Campaign</p>"><img src ="media/2014/mascotTbn.jpg" alt="Mascot for Anti-drug Campaign"></a>
							
						<a href ="media/2014/infographic.jpg" data-lightbox="bookInfographic" data-title="<h3>Book Infographic based on popularity (Sep. 2014)</h3><p>Project: To use our Illustrator skills that we've learned from last year, to create an infographic. An Infographic is some sort of a poster that expresses information to the public visually.</p><p>Reflection: It was a very great back-to-school project for the students. My teammates and I got to refresh our skills on Illustrator once again. It's also very enjoyable because we got to work with the people we like. Each color or category on the bookshelf represents a book genre and we picked the most popular books to showcase. In addition, we added symbols or pictures that can represent the book. Overall, the project was interesting and we got to practice our skills more intensely. </p>"><img src ="media/2014/infographicTbn.jpg" alt="Informational Graphic(Infographic) about popular books"></a>
							
						<a href ="media/2014/colorscheme.png" data-lightbox="colorScheme" data-title="<h3>Color Scheme Painting (Oct. 2014)</h3><p>Project: Take a picture and color it using four different type of color schemes. Warm colors, cool colors, monochromatic, complementary, etc.</p><p>Reflection: I enjoyed this painting a lot because I like drawing in the first place. It's also very interesting to alter a painting using different color schemes. The first blue section was analogous colors, or similar colors on the color wheel. The yellow-orange section was warm colors. The third purple part was monochromatic (same color but tints and shades) color scheme. And finally, the last section was complementary colors or colors opposite from each other on the color wheel. It was a great way to refresh our memory on color schemes.</p>"><img src ="media/2014/colorschemeTbn.jpg" alt="4 Color Scheme Artwork"></a>

I attend Southwest Career and Technical Academy, so NACTE is a larger event. I used Cubism to fill my bird since it was the area of art I was researching on. The bird means to fly into the future and gives a feeling of hope and freedom. The sun also has a new and fresh feeling to it which suits the topic of 'A Vision of Tomorrow'. I enjoyed designing the logos even though they were not chosen as the official logo of the conference. </p>"><img src ="media/logos/nacte-Tbn.png" alt="Logo Design for NACTE"></a>

						<a href ="media/logos/nacte-sun.png" data-lightbox="logoDesign" data-title="<h3>NACTE Logo Design #2 (Nov. 2014)</h3><p>This is the second logo concept I have. The sun represents future and hope which I think fits well with the theme of the conference.</p>"></a>

It helped the class to understand the client and what marketing really is. This made our sketching process easier and faster. I did 16 sketches and three of them were later developed in Illustrator. All logos involve some sort of Marketing Education whether it would be books, an apple, or bar graphs. I had fun creating these logos. Even though the client didn't choose my logo as their final one, I think it is a great experience working for a real client and making a celebratory logo.</p>"><img src ="media/logos/ME-Tbn.png" alt="Logo Design to Celebrate 80 Years of Marketing Education"></a>

						<a href ="media/logos/ME-2.png" data-lightbox="ME" data-title="<h3>80 Years of Marketing Education Logo #2 (Nov. 2015)</h3><p>This is the second logo design for celebrating Marketing Education. I wanted something more related to the business side of the prompt and created a book that is filled with marketing symbols.</p>"></a>

						<a href ="media/logos/ME-3.png" data-lightbox="ME" data-title="<h3>80 Years of Marketing Education Logo #3 (Nov. 2015)</h3><p>This is the last logo concept for Marketing Education. I personally really like this one because it incorporates the bar graph, which represented business and marketing, into the apple, which represented education.</p>"></a>

It would be great to use the color scheme of the LVGEA logo and make it modern.</p><p>Reflection: I really like doing this logo design. I've done another logo design for the 80th Year of Marketing Education and this logo followed right after which made me really stressful. But this time I got a clear understandign of what the client wants so the process of making it was much enjoyable than the last one. I wanted to create a type of logo that has a artistic feel. In this logo, the 60 is like drawn from a brush and I like the effect. The sun in the 0 represented the future and hope. It can also tie in with Las Vegas because there's a lot of sunshine in Nevada. I really like this logo I've created for the company.</p>"><img src ="media/logos/LVGEA-Tbn.png" alt="Celebrate 60th Anniversary of Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance"></a>
